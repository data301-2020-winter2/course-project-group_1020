# This is for raw data

## Loading data

Due to the massive size of our data set we cant have the csv uncompressed in git. So heres how we use the data

1. Un move and uncompress raw/terrorism.csv.zip out of the git repository.
2. Copy the path of your uncompressed csv
3. When you need to call your data import functions from the scripts folder.
